In collaboration with [Daoyi Liu](https://github.com/Jelligeth).

## Overview üìù

Welcome to the cub3D project! This project is a part of the 42 curriculum and involves creating a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective using ray-casting principles. This README will guide you through the setup, building, and execution of the project, providing all the necessary details to help you navigate and succeed in this journey.

## Introduction

Imagine yourself as a developer in the 90s, tasked with creating a 3D game engine from scratch. Your goal is to build a program that generates a realistic 3D maze, navigable from a first-person perspective. You will use the ray-casting technique, the same technology that powered early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D. Welcome to cub3D, where you bring these classic concepts to life using modern tools provided by the MiniLibX library.

## Getting Started

### Clone

Clone the repository including the MiniLibX submodule:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mcombeau/cub3D.git

Or:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/mcombeau/cub3D.git>
git submodule update --init --recursive

```


### Compile and Run

There are two versions of the program, the mandatory part and the bonus part. The bonus part adds wall collision, a minimap, and the ability to rotate the view by moving the mouse.

To compile the mandatory part, cd into the cloned directory and:

```bash
make

```

To compile the bonus part, cd into the cloned directory and:

```bash
make bonus

```

> Note: you may need to make fclean to switch between the mandatory and bonus compilations (working on a fix for this!).
> 

To run the program:

```bash
./cub3d <path/to/map.cub>

```

The program takes a map file as an argument. Maps are available in the `maps` directory. There are good maps which the program should run smoothly with, and bad maps which the program should reject. For example:

```bash
./cub3d maps/good/library.cub

```

should run.

```bash
./cub3d maps/bad/filetype_wrong.buc

```

should print an error and abort.

### Arguments

The program accepts one argument:

- A map file with the `.cub` extension, which describes the layout of the maze.

## Controls

The following controls should be implemented for navigating the maze:

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **Left Arrow**: Rotate left
- **Right Arrow**: Rotate right
- **ESC**: Close the window and quit the program
- **Red Cross on Window Frame**: Close the window and quit the program
- **Mouse**: Rotate by moving the mouse (bonus only)

## Map Format

The map file describes the layout of the maze and should contain:

- `0`: Empty space
- `1`: Wall
- `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`: Player‚Äôs start position and initial orientation

## Example .cub File üìù

Here‚Äôs an example of what a `.cub` file might look like:

```bash
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
F 220,100,0
C 225,30,0
